## Introduction

API Rate Limiting is a critical defense mechanism used by web services to protect against abuse and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks by restricting the number of requests a client can make in a given timeframe.

This project demonstrates:
- How APIs like GitHub's implement rate limits.
- How overloading a local server can simulate DoS vulnerabilities.
- How different rate-limiting strategies affect protection.
- Why some attacks, like Slow Loris, require additional mitigation beyond simple request counting.

## GitHub API Rate Limit Testing

### Base Information
- **API base URL:** `https://api.github.com`
- **Test endpoint:** `/users/octocat`
- **Rate limit check endpoint:** `/rate_limit`

### Limits
- **Unauthenticated:** 60 requests per hour.
- **Authenticated (using Personal Access Token):** 5000 requests per hour.

### Steps

1. **Check Rate Limit (Unauthenticated)**
    ```bash
    curl -i https://api.github.com/users/octocat
    ```
    **Observation:**  
    - Remaining Requests: 52 (out of 60).

2. **View Rate Limit Status**
    ```bash
    curl -i https://api.github.com/rate_limit
    ```

3. **Authenticated Request (Using Personal Access Token)**
    ```bash
    curl -i -H "Authorization: token YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
    ```

4. **Flooding Test (Light)**
    ```bash
    for i in {1..70}
    do
      curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://api.github.com/users/octocat
    done
    ```

    **Observation:**  
    - After exceeding the limit, received `403 Forbidden` responses.

5. **Burp Suite Intruder Testing**
    - Sending multiple requests and monitoring for `403` or `429` responses.

## Local API Testing (Flask)

A lightweight Flask server was used to simulate and understand rate limiting.

### Without Rate Limiting
- **Tool Used:** Apache Bench (ab)
    ```bash
    ab -n 1000 -c 1000 http://127.0.0.1:5000/test
    ```
    **Observation:**  
    - Server crashed/reset after handling too many concurrent requests due to Flaskâ€™s default single-threaded nature.

### With Basic Rate Limiting
- **Implemented:** Fixed Window Rate Limiting.
- **Test:**
    ```bash
    for i in {1..10}
    do
      curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/test
    done
    ```
    **Observation:**  
    - Server properly rejected the 11th request in a 10-second window.

## Slow Loris Attack Simulation

- **Attack Command:**
    ```bash
    slowloris 127.0.0.1 -p 5000 -s 200
    ```

    **Observation:**
    - Slow Loris attack kept live connections open, causing legitimate users to be unable to connect.
    - Normal API rate limiting methods **do not** protect against Slow Loris attacks.

## Types of Rate Limiting Techniques

| Technique               | Description                                                             |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed Window Counter     | Counts requests in fixed time intervals.                               |
| Sliding Window Log       | Records a timestamp log of each request for accurate counting.         |
| Sliding Window Counter   | Smoothes counts over a moving window.                                  |
| Token Bucket             | Adds tokens at a fixed rate; allows bursts if enough tokens are available. |
| Leaky Bucket             | Processes requests at a constant rate, queues excess ones.             |

## Conclusion

- API rate limiting protects services from being abused by excessive requests.
- GitHub enforces strict per-hour limits based on authentication.
- Local servers without concurrency control and rate limiting are vulnerable to DoS.
- **Fixed Window Rate Limiting** works against simple request floods but **not** against connection-holding attacks like **Slow Loris**.
- **Advanced defenses** like Token Bucket and connection timeout management are recommended for better protection.
